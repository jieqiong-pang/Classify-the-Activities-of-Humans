# Classify-the-Activities-of-Humans
## Project Introduction
An interesting task in machine learning is classification of time series. In this problem, we will classify the activities of humans based on time series obtained by a Wireless Sensor Network.
## Data Information
The dataset contains 7 folders that represent seven types of activities. In each folder, there are multiple files each of which represents an instant of a human performing an activity.1 Each file containis 6 time series collected from activities
of the same person, which are called avg rss12, var rss12, avg rss13, var rss13, vg rss23, and ar rss23. There are 88 instances in the dataset, each of which con- tains 6 time series and each time series has 480 consecutive values.
